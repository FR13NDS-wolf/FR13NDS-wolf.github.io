## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation

### Definitions

- **Account** means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service.
- **We** (also referred to as either "**Us**" or "**Our**" in this policy) refers to the owner of the provided Services. For the purpose of the GDPR, "We" are the Data Controller.
- **Cookies** are a small piece of data that the server sends to the user's browser and is stored at the user-side locally. It may contain an anonymous unique identifier that is carried and sent to the server the next time the browser re-initiates a request to the same server. Usually, it is used to tell the server whether different requests are from the same browser/user, such as keeping the user's login status.
- **Customers** (also referred to as either "**Your**" or "**Your**" in this policy) are those who utilize the services. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), You can be referred to as the "**Data Subject**" or as the "**User**" as you are the individual using the Service.
- **Data Controller** for the purposes of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), refers to "We" as the legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of the Personal Information.
- **End-Users** are who interact with our Service through the websites of our Integrators.
- **Integrators** are those who incorporate our Service into their website or service.
- **Personal Information** (also referred to as "**Personal Data**" in this policy), is any information recorded in an electric form or other forms that can identify an individual itself or when it is associated with other information. If the subject of several acts can be identified as the same person by a single piece of information (with or without simple assistance), then the information will be considered as Personal Information, and vice versa.
- **Personal Identifiable Information** is one type of Personal Information. If it is possible to directly identify, contact or accurately locate the corresponding single specific natural person through a single piece of information (without any assistance), then the information will be considered as Personal Identifiable Information, and vice versa. Personal Identifiable Information includes, without limitation, the individual's name, date of birth, identification card number or SSN, biometric identifier (e.g. photographs, fingerprints, palm prints, iris, etc.), address, telephone number, precise coordinates, etc.

<div class="message is-warning"><div class="message-body">

</div></div>

- **Non-personal Information** is any information recorded but cannot be directly linked to any particular individual by itself. Usually, this kind of information will be aggregated into categories, thus it is almost impossible to use this information to restore any personally relevant data about a particular individual.

- **Unique Identifier**, (sometimes called a unique ID or **UUID**) is a string of characters that is incorporated into a device by the manufacturer or server and can be used to uniquely identify the device or user.
- **Usage Data** (also referred to as "**Analytics Information**" in this policy) refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit). Typically we treat the information as Personal Information.
